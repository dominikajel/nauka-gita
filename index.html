<h1>It's my life </h1>
<p>
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted<br>
No silent prayer for the faith-departed<br>
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd<br>
You're gonna hear my voice<br>
When I shout it out loud<br>
</p>
<p>
It's my life<br>
It's now or never<br>
I ain't gonna live forever<br>
I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
(It's my life)<br>
</p>
<p>
This is for the ones who stood their ground<br>
It's for Tommy and Gina who never backed down<br>
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake<br>
Luck ain't enough<br>
You've got to make your own breaks<br>
</p>
<p>
It's my life<br>
And it's now or never<br>
I ain't gonna live forever<br>
I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
(It's my life)<br>
My heart is like an open highway<br>
Like Frankie said<br>
I did it my way<br>
I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
It's my life<br>
